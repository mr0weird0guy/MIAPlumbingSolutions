          We also offer help with backflow devices. When a backflow device is properly functioning, it provides a steady flow of water away from your home to avoid contamination. These devices require regular maintenance and prevention to guarantee your drinking water is safe to drink.

          Hard water is caused by calcium and magnesium, a combo that wreaks havoc on your appliances, your skin, and your energy bills. But there’s an easy fix: Installing a water softener removes those substances. You’ll notice a dramatic reduction of buildup on your bathtub, sinks, faucets, and wall tiles or shower surrounds. Your dishes will be less spotty, too, reducing the need for a rinse aid in your dishwasher. Next up, laundry—you’ll notice your whites will be whiter and your colors brighter. And installing a water softener also means appliances like your washing machine, dishwasher, coffee maker, and iron will last longer, so you don’t have to replace them as often.
        </p>
        <p class="hidden" id="detail[16]">
          Water softeners, water refiners, water-purification systems, and whole-home filtration systems can work together or separately to deliver safer, better-tasting water that also saves you money. Our water consultant can help determine which solution works best for your family’s unique needs.
        </p>
        <p class="hidden" id="detail[17]">
          Improve the quality of your family’s water with a whole-home filtration system that can remove harmful contaminants from both the water you drink and the water you use for bathing, laundry, dishes, and more. A softener and reverse-osmosis treatment system will make your water softer and taste better. 
          You’ll also save money on energy bills, and your budget and the environment will benefit too, because you can say goodbye to single-use plastic water bottles. Additionally, softer water reduces the amount of buildup in pipes and appliances, and it is gentle on your clothes, so they don’t wear out as fast.

          Mini Splits utilize two primary components: a compressor that stays outside of the home, and an air-handling unit indoors. Linked by a conduit, the two components work together to regulate temperate in every room where the unit is placed.
          Due to the setup of mini splits, they’re a great option for heating individual rooms – or zoning. Depending on the home’s heating system, you can have multiple air-handling units connected to the one outdoor unit, and every indoor unit is controlled by its own thermostat.
